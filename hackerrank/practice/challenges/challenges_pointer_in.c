/*In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C. A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable that it does not own.
Complete the function void update(int *a,int *b). It receives two integer pointers, int* a and int* b. Set the value of  to their sum, and  to their absolute difference. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.

#include <stdio.h>

void update(int *a,int *b) {
    *a=*a+*b;
    *b=*a-*b-*b;
    if(*b<0)
    *b=*b*(-1);
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    int *pa = &a, *pb = &b;
    
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    update(pa, pb);
    printf("%d\n%d", a, b);
